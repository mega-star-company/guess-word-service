✅ WHAT I FOUND:

You were RIGHT - the issue wasn't the models themselves!

The problem: We kept changing models without realizing that
BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 was ALREADY WORKING before we started
trying to optimize for Hebrew.

✅ THE FIX:

Reverted to: BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5
- This model was CONFIRMED working in your original setup
- It handles Hebrew text just fine for embeddings
- The API call format is proven to work

KEPT:
✅ 300 Hebrew words (daily rotation)
✅ Hebrew-only UI
✅ Daily word mode
✅ All game logic improvements

REMOVED:
❌ All the experimental model changes
❌ Complex embedding parsing logic
❌ The things that broke it!
