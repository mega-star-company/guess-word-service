# ✨ What Changed - Cloud-Based Version

## 🎯 Main Change

**Before:** Downloaded and ran 16GB model locally (slow, resource-intensive)  
**After:** Uses Hugging Face API (fast, lightweight, no downloads!)

## ✅ Benefits

1. **No Huge Downloads** - Only ~50MB of dependencies vs 16GB model
2. **Works on Any Machine** - No GPU or special hardware needed
3. **Faster Setup** - 3 steps, 2 minutes total
4. **FREE** - Hugging Face API has a generous free tier
5. **Always Up-to-Date** - Model improvements happen automatically

## 📦 What You Need Now

- Python 3.9+ ✅
- Free Hugging Face account (takes 1 minute) ✅
- ~50MB disk space ✅

## 🚀 Quick Start Summary

```bash
# 1. Install (1 minute)
cd service-repo
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure API key (1 minute)
./configure_api.sh
# Follow the prompts to add your HF token

# 3. Test (optional)
python3 test_connection.py

# 4. Run!
python3 main.py
```

## 📝 Files Changed

### New Files

- `configure_api.sh` - Easy API key setup
- `test_connection.py` - Verify your API works
- `SETUP.md` - Quick start guide
- `CHANGES.md` - This file
- `.env.example` - Template for API key

### Modified Files

- `main.py` - Now uses HF API instead of local model
- `requirements.txt` - Much smaller! No PyTorch, Transformers, etc.
- `README.md` - Updated with new instructions

### Removed Dependencies

- ❌ torch (was 2GB+)
- ❌ transformers (was 500MB+)
- ❌ accelerate
- ❌ flash-attn
- ✅ Added: httpx, python-dotenv (tiny!)

## 🔑 Getting Your API Key

1. Go to https://huggingface.co/join
2. Sign up (free, takes 1 minute)
3. Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
4. Click "Create new token"
5. Name: "semantle-api", Permission: "Read"
6. Copy the token (starts with `hf_`)
7. Run `./configure_api.sh` and paste it

That's it! 🎉

## 💡 Pro Tips

- First API call takes ~10-20s (model loading on HF servers)
- Subsequent calls are instant
- Embeddings are cached to reduce API calls
- Free tier is generous for personal projects
- API is much faster than running locally on CPU

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"API not configured"**
→ Run `./configure_api.sh` to set up your API key

**"Authentication failed"**
→ Check your API key in `.env` file, make sure it starts with `hf_`

**"Model is loading"**  
→ Normal for first request! Wait 10-20 seconds and try again

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
→ You've hit the free tier limit. Wait or upgrade to Pro tier

## 📊 Performance

| Metric         | Local (Before) | Cloud API (After) |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Setup Time     | 30-60 min      | 2 min             |
| Disk Space     | 16GB+          | 50MB              |
| RAM Needed     | 16GB+          | 1GB               |
| GPU Needed     | Recommended    | No                |
| First Request  | Fast           | 10-20s            |
| Later Requests | Fast           | <1s               |
| Cost           | Hardware       | Free tier         |
